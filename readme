djvubind

========
Dependencies

python3
djvulibre (specifically: cpaldjvu, djvm, djvused)
imagemagick
minidjvu
tesseract
cuneiform

You could forgo having tesseract and cuneiform installed so long as you always use the
--no-ocr option.

========
Installation

Installation should be as simple as "./setup.py install".  You can add --dry-run
if you want to check what will happen before doing it, or just use --help for
all the details on options.

N.b., at the moment most distributions are able to have python3 installed but do
not use that version by default.  If this is the case (and it probably is),
explicitly call python3 when installing (e.g. "python3 ./setup.py install")

========
Usage

Run djvubind in a directory that contains the files that should combined into the
djvu file.  Only files with .tif or .tiff extension will be included in the file.
Additionally, by default "bookmarks" and "metadata" files will be inserted if they
are present; they should be in the format used by djvused for print-outline and
print-meta.  A front or back cover image can also be provided in jpeg or tiff
formats.

An example directory:

cover_front.jpg
cover_back.jpg
bookmarks
metadata
page_0001.tif
page_0002.tif
...
page_n.tif

---
An example bookmarks file:

(bookmarks
 ("Cover" "#1" )
 ("Contents" "#7" )
)

Note the # symbol before the page number, and don't forget that if you have a cover
image, that will be page 1.

An example metadata file:

author "John Smith"
